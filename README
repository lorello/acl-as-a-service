A simple web service that checks an IP versus a list of IPs/networks and returns
TRUE or FALSE if the requested IP belongs to the list of IPs/networks configured

Setup
Rename aws-config-sample.json in aws-config.json and change credentials to query
AWS.

GET     /lists            get the lists of lists
POST    /lists/$name      create a new list and populate it with the BODY
PUT     /lists/$name      replace existing list with the body contents
DELETE  /lists/$name      remove the list

GET     /lists/$name      get the list of IPs present in $list
GET     /lists/$name/$ip  check if $ip is present in list $list
POST    /lists/$name/$ip  add $ip to list $name
DELETE  /lists/$name/$ip  remove $ip from list $name

The PUT and DELETE methods are idempotent methods. The GET method is a safe method (or nullipotent), meaning that calling it produces no side-effects.

Sometimes in the future a users entity should be added and each user should create his own list of IPs
